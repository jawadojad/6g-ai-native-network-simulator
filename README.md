# 6G AI-Native Network Simulator

A visionary project to explore **AI-assisted 6G networks** and future telecom programmability.  
This sandbox allows experimentation with **network slicing, ML-based resource allocation, and API-driven orchestration**.

## 🚀 Overview
- Simulates 6G-inspired use cases: IoT, AR/VR, autonomous systems.
- Lightweight ML model recommends slice allocation strategies.
- Exposes APIs for developers to test configurations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (FastAPI)
- Cloud Run (free tier deployment)
- ML libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow Lite for demo)
- OpenAPI + Postman

## ✨ Features
- Network slicing sandbox (simulated workloads).
- AI-driven recommendations for optimal allocation.
- REST APIs for integration.

## 📈 Roadmap
- [ ] Basic simulator with REST API.
- [ ] Add ML recommendation engine.
- [ ] Extend to GCP Cloud Run deployment.

## 📂 Status
🚧 Visionary / Long-term – Early planning.
